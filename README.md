# Assignment-3
# Task 1:
I used both recursion loop and "for" keyword to solve this task. In which "n" is the common variable for the user to input a number. Both ways, 
would obviously return the same output

Output:
Enter a number for its factorial: 5
The factorial of 5 is: 120

# Task 2:
To solve this task, I used math module(pre-built) through keyword "import" and variable n to store the user's input. 
I used functions like math.sqrt() to calculate square root of the entered number, math.log() to calculate logarithm
of the entered number and math.sin() to calculate sine of the entered number.

Output:
Enter a number
25
The square root of 25 = 5.0
The logarithm of 25 = 3.2188758248682006
The Sine of 25 = -0.13235175009777303
